# ShadowOne EDR

Realtime Endpoint Detection & Response Platform for behavioral threat detection, incident correlation, attack visibility, and security monitoring.

ShadowOne is a modern SOC-style EDR platform built using Python, FastAPI, React, MongoDB, and WebSockets. It collects endpoint telemetry in realtime, detects suspicious behavior, maps detections to MITRE ATT&CK techniques, correlates attack chains into incidents, and streams live security events to an interactive dashboard.

# Features

## Realtime Telemetry Streaming

* Live endpoint telemetry collection
* Realtime WebSocket streaming using Socket.IO
* Instant dashboard updates
* Multi-host monitoring

---

## Behavioral Detection Engine

ShadowOne detects suspicious endpoint activity including:

### Encoded PowerShell Detection

Detects:

```powershell id="4jlwm8"
powershell.exe -EncodedCommand ...
```

MITRE:

```text id="jlwmk4"
T1059.001 — PowerShell
```

---

### LOLBins Detection

Detects abuse of:

* certutil.exe
* mshta.exe
* rundll32.exe
* regsvr32.exe

MITRE:

```text id="jlwmc0"
T1218 — Signed Binary Proxy Execution
```

---

### Suspicious Process Chains

Detects:

```text id="yjlwm1"
cmd.exe → powershell.exe
```

MITRE:

```text id="0jlwm9"
T1059 — Command and Scripting Interpreter
```

---

# MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

ShadowOne maps detections to MITRE ATT&CK techniques for attack classification and threat analysis.

| Technique ID | Technique Name                    | Detection               |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| T1059.001    | PowerShell                        | Encoded PowerShell      |
| T1059        | Command and Scripting Interpreter | CMD spawning PowerShell |
| T1218        | Signed Binary Proxy Execution     | LOLBins abuse           |

---

# Threat Correlation Engine

ShadowOne correlates suspicious telemetry into attack incidents.

Instead of isolated alerts:

```text id="7jlwm8"
PowerShell detected
```

ShadowOne builds attack chains:

```text id="9jlwm6"
cmd.exe
   ↓
powershell.exe
   ↓
network activity
```

This simulates modern EDR investigation workflows.

---

# Network Monitoring

Realtime monitoring of:

* outbound connections
* remote IPs
* ports
* process-based network activity

The platform filters localhost noise and displays meaningful external traffic.

---

# Threat Scoring

Dynamic threat scoring based on:

* severity
* suspicious behavior
* process execution chains

| Severity | Score |
| -------- | ----- |
| Critical | 100   |
| High     | 70    |
| Medium   | 40    |

Additional suspicious behavior increases threat score dynamically.
